Developer Guide
===============

Prerequisites
=============

You will need Python 3.5 installed.

Setup
=====

Bootstrap the project::

    $ python bootstrap.py
    $ bin/buildout -N

Install the package dependencies::

    $ bin/npm install

Building the App
================

Build the app like so::

    $ bin/npm run-script build

To run the admin UI as a standalone app, open the ``build/index.html`` file in
your browser.

Running the App for Development
===============================

Start the development server on port ``9000``::

    $ bin/npm start

You should now be able to access the app at: http://localhost:9000/

Connecting to CrateDB
=====================

You will need to enable *Cross-Origin Resource Sharing* in your
`CrateDB configuration`_ to test the admin UI against it::

    http.cors.enabled: true
    http.cors.allow-origin: "*"

You can then use the ``base_uri`` parameter to specify the URL of your CrateDB
node, like so::

    http://localhost:9000/?base_uri=http://localhost:4200

This  ``base_uri`` parameter is intended for development use only.

Adding New Dependencies
=======================

Application dependencies should be added as follow::

    $ bin/npm install [dependency] --save

This dependency should then be imported in ``./app/vendor.module.js``,
for the application to load correctly.

If the dependency is an angular module, it should also be included in ``MODULES``
in ``./app/app.module.js``

Dev dependencies should be added as follow::

    $ bin/npm install [dependency] --save-dev

Adding New Components
=====================

When a new component is created (a module or a service or a controller),
it should be imported to ``./app/app.components.js``.

Adding New Stylesheets
======================

When a new stylesheet is created it should be imported to
``./styles/styles.scss`` and/or ``./styles/styles-enterprise.scss``

Vendor styles should also be imported to ``./styles/styles.scss``
and ``./styles/styles-enterprise.scss``

Running Tests
=============

You can run the tests like so::

    $ bin/npm test

Plugins
=======

On startup, the ``conf/plugins.json`` file is read and plugins
(Angular modules) are loaded.

The `tutorial plugin`_ is loaded by the default configuration.

Preparing a Release
===================

Before releasing, run through the `Admin UI Release Preflight`_.

To create a new release, you must:

- Add the new version to ``package.json``

- Add a section for the new version in the ``CHANGES.txt`` file

- Commit your changes with a message like "prepare release x.y.z"

- Push to origin

- Create a tag by running ``./devtools/create_tag.sh``

- Run the ``crate-admin_release`` job in Jenkins

Writing Documentation
=====================

The docs live under the ``docs`` directory.

The docs are written written with ReStructuredText_ and processed with Sphinx_.

Build the docs by running::

    $ bin/sphinx

The output can then be found in the ``out/html`` directory.

The docs are automatically built from Git by `Read the Docs`_ and there is
nothing special you need to do to get the live docs to update.
