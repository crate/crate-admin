Developer Guide
===============

Prerequisites
=============

You will need Python 3.5 installed.

Setup
=====

Bootstrap the project::

    $ python bootstrap.py
    $ bin/buildout -N

Install the package dependencies::

    $ bin/npm install
    $ bin/bower install

Building the App
================

Build the app like so::

    $ bin/grunt build

To run the admin UI as a standalone app, open the ``dist/index.html`` file in
your browser.

Running the App for Development
===============================

Start the development server on port ``9000``::

    $ bin/grunt server

You should now be able to access the app at: http://localhost:9000/

Connecting to CrateDB
=====================

You will need to enable *Cross-Origin Resource Sharing* in your
`CrateDB configuration`_ to test the admin UI against it::

    http.cors.enabled: true
    http.cors.allow-origin: "*"

You can then use the ``base_uri`` parameter to specify the URL of your CrateDB
node, like so::

    http://localhost:9000/?base_uri=http://localhost:4200

This  ``base_uri`` parameter is intended for development use only.

Running Tests
=============

You can run the tests like so::

    $ bin/grunt test

Plugins
=======

On startup, the ``conf/plugins.json`` file is read and plugins
(Angular modules) are loaded.

The `tutorial plugin`_ is loaded by the default configuration.

Preparing a Release
===================

To create a new release, you must:

- Add the new version to ``bower.json`` and ``package.json``

- Add a section for the new version in the ``CHANGES.txt`` file

- Commit your changes with a message like "prepare release x.y.z"

- Push to origin

- Create a tag by running ``./devtools/create_tag.sh``

- Run the ``crate-admin_release`` job in Jenkins
