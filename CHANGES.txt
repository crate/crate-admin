Changes for Crate Admin Interface
=================================

Unreleased
==========

 - Fix: Rename cluster check indicator on statusbar to ``Checks``.

 - Improved display of recovery percentage in table view

 - Fix: relocating shards where previously displayed as "underreplicated" shards
   causing a yellow cluster state while relocating was in progress

 - Fix: change in calculation of recovery percentage broke calculations for
   partitioned tables causing table partitions not showing up

 - Fix: now also include unassigned shards (as 0% recovered) in calculation of
   recovery percentage which is displayed per table.

   unassigned shards.

   granular state now and relocating shards are listed, too.
