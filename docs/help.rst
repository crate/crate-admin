  If you're just getting started with CrateDB, a good way to get a feel for the
  system is to have some data to play around with. Select *IMPORT TWEEETS FOR
  TESTING* to authenticate with Twitter and import tweets from the public
  timeline.

  A table named ``tweets`` is created for your automatically.

  A tweets count indicator will show you how many tweets have been imported.
  When you are satisfied with the number of imported tweets, select the
  *ENOUGH! STOP IMPORTING TWEETS* button.

  .. TIP::

     This feature does not tweet or follow anyone on your behalf.
