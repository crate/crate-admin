The CrateDB admin UI comes with a *tables browser* that allows you to inspect
and query regular `document tables`_ as well as `BLOB tables`_.

Document Tables
---------------

Here's what a simple document table looks like:

.. image:: tables-simple-1.png

Here you can see a number of :ref:`table-level datapoints and settings are
<table-level-info>` listed.

Below this, you will find information about the table :ref:`schema
<schema-info>`:

.. image:: tables-simple-2.png

BLOB Tables
-----------

If you have BLOB tables, you can access them by selecting the *Blob Tables* menu
item on the left-hand sub-navigation menu:

.. image:: tables-blobs-1.png

Like document tables, a number of :ref:`table-level datapoints and settings
<table-level-info>` are listed first, and then below that, you will find
information about the table :ref:`schema <schema-info>`:

.. _table-level-info:

Table-Level Information
-----------------------

The table overview displays the following table-level information:

:Name:

  The name of the table.

:Health:

  The health of the table.

  Each table `shard`_ has a corresponding health status. The table-level health
  status always reflects the worst shard status. (Similarly, the
  :ref:`cluster-level status <status-bar>` always reflects the worst
  table-level status.)

  Shards can be one of the following:

  :Green:

    The primary shard and all replica shards are allocated to a node.

  :Yellow:

    The primary shard is allocated, but not all replica shards are allocated to
    a node.

  :Red:

    This specific shard is not allocated to a node.

:Configured Replicas:

  The number of configured `replicas`_.

:Configured Shards:

  The `number of configured shards`_

:Started Shards:

  The number of started shards allocated to a node and available for querying.

:Missing Shards:

  The total number of known shards that are missing on disk.

:Underrepl. Shards:

  The total number of configured replica shards that are currently missing
  (i.e. not created or re-created yet).

:Total Records:

  The total number of records (i.e. rows) the table has.

:Unavailable Records:

  The total number of records that should exist in missing shards.

:Underrepl. Records:

  The total number of records that do not have the required number of replica
  copies.

:Size:

  The total size on disk used by all primary shards.

:Recovery:

  The percentage of the recovery process that is complete (i.e. when re-starting
  a cluster).

.. _schema-info:

Schema Information
------------------

The table schema section displays information about each table column:

:Name:

  The name of the table column.

:Type:

  The column `data type`_.

Other Features
--------------

:Table |nbsp| type |nbsp| toggle:

  Document tables and BLOB tables can be shown or hidden by toggling the
  corresponding arrow button on the left-hand sub-navigation menu.

:Table |nbsp| filter:

  The displayed list of tables can be filtered by entering text to match
  against the table name in the *Filter tables* text input.

:Table |nbsp| querying:

  Each table can be queried directly by selecting the *QUERY TABLE* button. This
  will take you through to the :ref:`console` and pre-populate a basic query
  against the table. The query is not executed automatically.
