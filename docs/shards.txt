Shards Browser
==============

The CrateDB admin UI comes with a *shards browser* that provides you with a
visual overview of all the `shards`_ in your cluster.

.. NOTE::

   The shards browser is an `enterprise feature`_.

Screenshot

Here's what a simple database might look like:

.. image:: shards-simple.png

In this example, there are two primary columns:

- The *blob* column holds `BLOB tables`_

- The *doc* column holds regular `document tables`_

The *blob* column lists a single table:

- ``my_blobs``

The *doc* column lists two tables:

- ``another_table``
- ``tweets``

The table has a single row corresponding to the one node in this cluster.
CrateDB automatically names unnamed nodes. In this instance, there is a single
node named *Monte Civetta*.

In this example, the *Monte Civetta* node is holding the following shards:

- Three shards for the table named ``my_blobs``
- Four shards for the table named ``another_table``
- Four shards for the table named ``tweets``

Shards are colored to indicate their status and there is a color key at the
top of the table.

The color of the shards in this example indicates that they are all primary
shards and have been successfully started.

:Shard |nbsp| ID |nbsp| display:

  You can toggle the display of shard IDs by selecting or unselecting the *Show
  Shard IDs* checkbox.

:Shard |nbsp| status:

  Each shard is colored according to its status:

  :Started |nbsp| Primary: (bright green)

     This is a primary shard that has been successfully started, allocated to
     a node, and is available for querying.

  :Started |nbsp| Replica: (dark green)

     This is a `replica`_ shard that has been successfully started, allocated to
     a node, and is available for querying.

  :Initializing: (dark yellow)

     The shard is being initialized (i.e. being started).

  :Relocating: (dark red)

     The shard is being relocated to another node.

     CrateDB automatically rebalances your cluster for you. While a shard is
     being moved to another node, it is unavailable for use.

  :Unassigned: (gray)

     The shard exists on disk, but has not yet been allocated to a node.
