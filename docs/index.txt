====================
The CrateDB Admin UI
====================

CrateDB ships with a web administration user interface (UI), or *admin UI* for
short.

The CrateDB admin UI runs on every CrateDB node, and you can use it to inspect
and interact with the whole CrateDB cluster in a number of ways.

.. rubric:: Table of Contents

.. contents::
   :local:

Connecting
==========

The admin UI is accessible via HTTP at port ``4200``, at a URL like so::

  http://HOSTNAME:4200/

Here, replace ``HOSTNAME`` with the hostname of the CrateDB node. If CrateDB
is running locally, this will be ``localhost``.

.. NOTE::

    If port ``4200`` is accessed via a client library or command line tool like
    ``curl`` or ``wget``, the request will be handled by `the CrateDB Rest
    API`_, and the response will be JSON.

Overview
========

Here's what the admin UI will look like when it first loads:

.. NOTE::

   This is the `Enterprise version`_ of admin UI. The community version uses a
   lighter theme.

The navigation is split into two parts:

- The `status bar`_ (along the top)

- The `tabs`_ (down the left-hand side)

Along the top of the screen, from left to right, the status bar has:
