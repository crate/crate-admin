The CrateDB Admin UI
====================

CrateDB ships with a web administration user interface (UI), or *admin UI* for
short.

The CrateDB admin UI runs on every CrateDB node, and you can use it to inspect
and interact with the whole CrateDB cluster in a number of ways.

.. SEEALSO::

   The CrateDB admin UI is an open source project and is `hosted on GitHub`_.

Connecting
==========

The admin UI is accessible via HTTP at port ``4200``, at a URL like so::

  http://HOSTNAME:4200/

Here, replace ``HOSTNAME`` with the hostname of the CrateDB node. If CrateDB
is running locally, this will be ``localhost``.

.. TIP::

    If port ``4200`` is accessed via a client library or command line tool like
    ``curl`` or ``wget``, the request will be handled by `the CrateDB Rest
    API`_, and the response will be JSON.

.. _the CrateDB Rest API: https://crate.io/docs/crate/reference/en/latest/interfaces/http.html

Overview Screen
===============

Here's what the admin UI will look like when it first loads:

.. NOTE::

   This is the `Enterprise version`_ of admin UI. The community version uses a
   lighter theme.

.. _Enterprise version: https://crate.io/docs/crate/reference/en/latest/enterprise/index.html

The navigation is split into two parts:

- The `status bar`_ (along the top)

- The `tabs`_ (down the left-hand side)
